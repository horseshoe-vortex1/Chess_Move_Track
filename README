# Chess move track
# 
# This is a C++ program to read an imput of 64 boolean inputs and determine
# the moves made in a chess game.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Chess move track project has two phases. The first is to record moves made in a physical game
# and convert that to a digital output to a computer. The second phase (which will be the present focus)
# will involve processing that input to perform the following operations.
# 
#	1. Based on a vector of 64 boolean inputs, identify the moves made.
#		a. Define objects for the board, pieces and players to define the initial configuration.
#		b. Check if a move is made, a piece is taken or castling.
#	
#	2. Develop a rule set for each piece to validate the moves made, for instance checks.
#
#	3. Generate outputs in specific formats to enable analysis of the game.
